Heroes Of Pymoli homework

3 observable trends based on the data

1) Men are by far the most prevalent of players of Heroes of Pymoli, taking up 84% of the player population. 
However, female & non-disclosed gender players spend more on average on optional purchases. 
Maketing and sales should primarily focus on male based interests to increase their optional purchase sales revenue.
But don't forget about the ladies & non-disclosed because they're out there and willing to spend! 
A marketing push for more female players and optional purchases that appeal to that gender group may see an increased player count and revenue overall.

2) Close to 45% of players are in the 20-24 age range, however, those in the 35-39 age range tend to spend more on average. 
While it makes sense to continue to market to potential players in the 20-24 age range group, add on purchases catering to those in the 35-39 range may get you more revenue. 
Interestingly, the under 10 age range group is a close second to highest average purchase at $4.54/person vs the 35-39 age range at $4.76/person. 
I don't feel good about marketing viedo games to children under 10, but their parents seem to be on board with the additional purchases so it's worth a look into that demographic.

3) Final Critic, Oathbreaker & Fiery Glass Crusader are your most popular, and your most profitable sellable items. Continue to push these items to your users!
Nirvana and Singed Scalpel are in your top 5 most profitable items, but are not the most popular purchase items you have. An advertising push onthese add ons may bring in more revenue.
